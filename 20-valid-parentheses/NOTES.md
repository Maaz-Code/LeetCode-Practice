* The basic idea is to push the right parentheses ')', ']', or '}' into the stack each time when we encounter left ones. And if a right bracket appears in the string, we need check if the stack is empty and also whether the top element is the same with that right bracket. If not, the string is not a valid one. At last, we also need check if the stack is empty.
* Â If we get a string like this "[[" then the stack will contain these parentheses "]]". In this case, we don't get any closed parentheses hence there is no pop operation for checking whether the top of the stack is the same as the current character that's why in the end we have to make sure wether our stack is empty or not
